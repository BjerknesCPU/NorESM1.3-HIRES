Known Limitations:
                                 1147 (mkgriddata can't straddle over Greenwich)
                                 1025 (SCM mode can NOT use a global finidat file)
                                 1017 (SCM mode can NOT restart)
                                  896 (T62 mode does not work)
                                  701 (svn keyword)
                                  452 (Problem with support of soil-colors != 8 or 20)

Describe any changes made to build system:

List all files eliminated:

List all files added and what they do:

List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:

CLM testing:

[... Remove before making trunk_tag.  Available test levels:

    a) regular (must be run before handing off a tag to SEs and must be run
     before committing a tag)
    b) build_namelist (if namelists and/or build_system changed))
    c) tools (only if tools are modified and no CLM source is modified)
    d) short (for use during development and in rare cases where only a small
          change with known behavior is added ... eg. a minor bug fix)
    e) doc (no source testing required)

... ]

  build-namelist tests:

    yellowstone

  unit-tests (models/lnd/clm/src):

    yellowstone

  regular tests (aux_clm40, aux_clm45, with '-model_gen_comp clm2'):

    yellowstone_intel
    yellowstone_pgi
    yellowstone_gnu (clm45 only)
    goldbach_nag

CLM tag used for the baseline comparisons: 

Changes answers relative to baseline:

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations:
    - what platforms/compilers:
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff?

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename: 

   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate:
